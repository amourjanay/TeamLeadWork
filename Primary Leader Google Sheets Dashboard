Emoji indicator of message type
Clear, concise description
Relevant context
Action items (if applicable)
Example Message Templates


Shift Start
üåÖ Shift Initiated
üë§ Shift Leader: [Name]
‚è∞ Start Time: [Date/Time]
üìã Team Strength: [Number of Counselors]
üö® Current Alert Levels: 
   - System Status: Operational
   - Emotional Support Capacity: High
   - Crisis Intervention Readiness: Fully Staffed
üìù Key Focus Areas:
   - Maintain compassionate, trauma-informed support
   - Prioritize caller safety and well-being
   - Ensure comprehensive documentation
üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Shift Intention: Creating a safe, affirming space for LGBTQ+ individuals
Shift Start Protocol
When beginning a shift, the shift leader should:
Log the shift start message in the Shift Thread
Conduct a brief team check-in
Review any open cases or pending interventions
Assess current team emotional and operational readiness
Ensure all systems and resources are fully operational
Resolving SpreadsheetApp.getUI Challenges
Common UI-Related Challenges in Google Apps Script
Google Apps Script can be particularly sensitive when working with UI components. Here are strategies to mitigate common issues:
1. Defensive UI Initialization
function safeGetUI() {
  try {
    // Primary method
    return SpreadsheetApp.getUi();
  } catch (primaryError) {
    try {
      // Fallback method
      return HtmlService.createHtmlOutput()
        .setWidth(300)
        .setHeight(100)
        .setTitle('System Notification');
    } catch (fallbackError) {
      // Absolute last resort - logging
      console.error('UI Access Failed', {
        primaryError: primaryError.toString(),
        fallbackError: fallbackError.toString()
      });
      
      // Log error through alternative method
      logError(primaryError, 'UI_ACCESS_FAILURE');
      
      return null;
    }
  }
}

// Usage in functions
function showAlert(message) {
  const ui = safeGetUI();
  
  if (ui) {
    try {
      ui.alert('System Notification', message, ui.ButtonSet.OK);
    } catch (alertError) {
      // Fallback logging
      console.error('Alert Display Failed', alertError);
      logError(alertError, 'ALERT_DISPLAY_FAILURE');
    }
  }
}
2. Error Handling Strategies
Always use try-catch blocks
Provide multiple fallback mechanisms
Log errors comprehensively
Create graceful degradation paths
3. Best Practices
Avoid direct UI calls in time-triggered functions
Use HTML service for complex interactions
Implement comprehensive error logging
Create safe wrapper functions
Recommended Approach for Modal and UI Interactions
function showSafeModal(htmlFile, title, width = 600, height = 500) {
  try {
    const html = HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile(htmlFile)
      .setWidth(width)
      .setHeight(height)
      .setTitle(title);
    
    const ui = safeGetUI();
    if (ui) {
      ui.showModalDialog(html, title);
    } else {
      // Fallback logging or alternative display method
      console.error(`Modal Display Failed: ${title}`);
      logError(new Error('Modal Display Failure'), 'MODAL_DISPLAY');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Modal Creation Error', error);
    logError(error, 'MODAL_CREATION');
  }
}

Queue Rotations: All Leaders
Primary
Setting up your Primary rotation
Check for scheduled callbacks during your shift rotation.
Review for any nuances and/or time zone discrepancies to be corrected
Schedule messages for volunteers for callbacks
Review Shift Messaging Cadence below to determine which Start of Shift, Mid Shift Check-In, and End of Shift Messages should be scheduled and sent during the designated Primary rotation
Start and update a Shift thread, utilizing the standard template, to document all relevant details for this rotation.
Pin it to the channel for subsequent shifts to review. Remove pins more than 24 hours old.
Confirm attendance in the 988 Lifeline Schedule file
Make sure all Counselors are in Ready 10 minutes after their shift starts; if not, check in and provide support, or update the attendance tracker accordingly
Please makes sure you or another leader is able to support a Counselor experiencing technical issues
Managing Your Primary rotation
Check the Follow-Up Reports for review (and later call-in, if applicable/able)
Ensure all necessary interventions and reports are reviewed and called in as soon as possible, including delegating to fellow supervisors when appropriate
Remain aware of slack channels for requests to support a Counselor with a coco or debrief and ensure all requests are promptly addressed
Primaries may support a coco, only after all on queue and admin leaders are on cocos or away on a break. Folks in Admin should be called into the queue as needed to ensure all safety concerns do not go unsupported.
Remain aware of the #988-sup-group channel to coordinate any IOC‚Äôs or other support for our Digital colleagues
Ensure a shift leader opens and supervises the watercooler for Counselors who are ending their shift.
Closing your Primary rotation
Capture any outstanding tasks or issues into the #988-lifeline-supervision Slack channel in your shift thread for the next supervision crew, including any incomplete reports requiring review or call-in.
Notify of any abuse reports requiring managerial review in the #988-ll-supstls Slack channel, so that Managers can review cases requiring additional considerations.
Primary- eye in the sky, should be communicating what they‚Äôre working on and if they‚Äôre delegating any duties. It‚Äôs not just scheduling messages, it‚Äôs overseeing the entire 3-4 hour segment, keeping an eye out for who‚Äôs doing what, and ensuring things flow smoothly for CW‚Äôs and fellow leaders.
Primary should designate a backup primary to take over watch when leaving for break/lunch
looking out for things like overstacked callback times and gameplanning
Identifying admin rotations, any shadows or buddy connections during time that may impact coverage
Primary should and can delegate within reason
On queue leaders should check w/ primary before taking over any non queue specific tasks to ensure workflows are not disrupted.
Communication is key.
