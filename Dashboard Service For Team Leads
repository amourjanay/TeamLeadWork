# Enhanced Crisis Services Team Management System
## Comprehensive Design & Implementation Guide

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a complete Google Apps Script-based management system specifically designed for crisis services team leaders. The system integrates counselor quality reviews, one-on-one meeting management, metrics tracking, and team coordination within a cohesive platform that supports the unique needs of crisis intervention services, particularly for LGBTQ+ support teams. This solution is designed to be duplicated and used by any team lead, with no hard-coded user information.

## The Critical Role of Google Sheets in This System

The Google Sheet serves as the central database for this entire system, providing several key advantages:

1. **Centralized Data Repository**: All team member information, metrics, quality reviews, and one-on-one notes are stored in a structured, accessible format that can be backed up, shared, and analyzed.

2. **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Team leads can access data from any device with internet access, ensuring continuity of supervision even in a 24/7 service environment.

3. **Permission-Based Security**: Confidential information about counselor performance and development can be protected through Google's robust permission system.

4. **Integration Capabilities**: The system seamlessly connects with Google Calendar, Gmail, and other G Suite tools to create a comprehensive team management ecosystem.

5. **Scalability**: As teams grow, the sheet-based architecture can scale to accommodate additional team members and expanded data requirements.

6. **No Hard-Coded User Information**: The system is designed to be duplicated and used by any team lead, with all user information stored in the sheet rather than coded into the application.

The overall system relies on a sheet structure with multiple tabs for different data categories, ensuring information is both organized and interconnected.

## UI Style Implementation

The system will implement a modern, professional UI style with the following characteristics:

```
I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our priority coaching session tonight January 23rd, to recap what we discussed and outline the steps we'll be taking together to ensure you feel supported as you grow in your role. The focus of our conversation is to align your work with our organization's mission of providing compassionate and high-quality support to every caller.

During our discussion, we identified key behaviors to prioritize:

1. **Call Timeliness:** Ensuring calls are answered promptly is essential to building trust and engagement. Moving forward, we'll focus on answering calls within 20 seconds to prevent delays in support.

2. **Engagement in Safety Assessments:** Promptly addressing safety concerns is a cornerstone of our work. We'll work on consistently asking the initial safety question earlier in the call (within the first 5-10 minutes) and continuing to assess thoroughly as the conversation unfolds.

3. **Exploring Support Needs:** Fully understanding and addressing the caller's needs—especially when specific requests arise—is critical to providing meaningful support. Strengthening these conversations will help build rapport and ensure the caller feels cared for.

4. **Language and Boundaries:** Incorporating gender-neutral language consistently shows our commitment to inclusivity. Maintaining professional boundaries by avoiding personal disclosures is equally important for fostering a safe and focused environment for our callers.

**Next Steps:** To help you implement these adjustments, here's our plan:
* This week, we'll schedule a shadow session where I'll observe your calls and provide real-time feedback on timeliness, engagement, and language use. This will be a collaborative opportunity to practice and refine these behaviors.
* I encourage you to reflect on the areas above and consider how you can adapt your approach to align with these goals before our shadow session.
* We'll reconnect within the next week to celebrate your growth moments and address any ongoing areas for improvement as needed.

I'm confident in your ability to integrate these changes and feel supported every step of the way. This process is about helping you feel more empowered in your role while continuing to deliver the best possible care to those who rely on us.

Looking forward to working together and seeing your progress!

Kindest,
[Team Lead Name]

## SpreadsheetApp.getUi() Avoidance Strategy

### Key Strategies for Avoiding SpreadsheetApp.getUi()

1. **Client-Side Validation**: Implement comprehensive form validation in JavaScript rather than relying on server-side alerts.

2. **Custom Notification System**: Build your own toast notifications and modal dialogs within your HTML interfaces instead of using native Google dialogs.

3. **Batch Processing**: Reduce server round-trips by collecting and processing multiple items in a single server call.

4. **Progressive UI Feedback**: Provide immediate visual feedback without requiring server communication.

5. **Dynamic Form Generation**: Generate forms on the client side based on configuration data.

6. **Client-Side Data Caching**: Store frequently accessed data (like team members) in client-side cache to avoid unnecessary server calls.

7. **Optimized Sheet Interactions**: Structure your server-side code to minimize processing time.

### Implementation Examples

#### Custom Notification System (Instead of getUi().alert())
```javascript
// CLIENT-SIDE NOTIFICATION
function showCustomAlert(message, type = 'info') {
  const toast = document.createElement('div');
  toast.className = `toast toast-${type}`;
  toast.innerHTML = `
    <div class="toast-icon">
      <i class="fas fa-${type === 'success' ? 'check-circle' : 
                        type === 'error' ? 'exclamation-circle' : 
                        'info-circle'}"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="toast-message">${message}</div>
  `;
  
  document.getElementById('toast-container').appendChild(toast);
  
  // Animate in
  setTimeout(() => toast.classList.add('show'), 10);
  
  // Auto dismiss
  setTimeout(() => {
    toast.classList.remove('show');
    setTimeout(() => toast.remove(), 300);
  }, 3000);
}
```

#### Client-Side Form Validation (Instead of getUi().alert())
```javascript
// CLIENT-SIDE VALIDATION
function validateQualityReviewForm() {
  const counselorName = document.getElementById('counselorName').value.trim();
  const interactionDate = document.getElementById('interactionDate').value;
  const errors = [];
  
  // Validate required fields
  if (!counselorName) {
    errors.push("Counselor name is required");
    highlightField('counselorName');
  }
  
  if (!interactionDate) {
    errors.push("Interaction date is required");
    highlightField('interactionDate');
  }
  
  // Validate all criteria are rated
  const criteriaIds = ['opening1', 'opening2', 'risk1', 'risk2', 'comm1', 'comm2', 'comm3', 
                      'support1', 'support2', 'closure1', 'closure2'];
  
  criteriaIds.forEach(id => {
    if (!document.querySelector(`input[name="${id}"]:checked`)) {
      errors.push(`Please rate the criterion: ${getCriterionName(id)}`);
    }
  });
  
  // Display errors
  if (errors.length > 0) {
    showErrorToast(errors.join("<br>"));
    return false;
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

### Email Follow-Up Implementation

A key feature of this system is the ability to send follow-up emails after various interactions. Here's how it will be implemented:

#### Email Template System
```javascript
// EMAIL TEMPLATE SYSTEM
function generateEmailContent(templateType, sessionData, customizations = {}) {
  let template;
  
  // Select base template
  switch (templateType) {
    case 'oneOnOne':
      template = getOneOnOneEmailTemplate();
      break;
    case 'coaching':
      template = getCoachingEmailTemplate();
      break;
    case 'qualityReview':
      template = getQualityReviewEmailTemplate();
      break;
    case 'custom':
      template = customizations.customTemplate || getDefaultEmailTemplate();
      break;
    default:
      template = getDefaultEmailTemplate();
  }
  
  // Replace variables with actual data
  const emailContent = replacePlaceholders(template, sessionData);
  
  // Apply custom formatting if needed
  return applyCustomFormatting(emailContent, customizations);
}

// Email sending function
function sendFollowUpEmail(recipientEmail, recipientName, subject, emailContent) {
  // Show preview to team lead first
  showEmailPreview(recipientEmail, recipientName, subject, emailContent, () => {
    // After approval, send the email
    google.script.run
      .withSuccessHandler(function(result) {
        if (result.success) {
          showSuccessToast("Follow-up email sent successfully");
        } else {
          showErrorToast("Failed to send email: " + result.error);
        }
      })
      .withFailureHandler(function(error) {
        showErrorToast("Error sending email: " + error);
      })
      .sendEmail(recipientEmail, subject, emailContent);
  });
}

// Email preview modal
function showEmailPreview(recipientEmail, recipientName, subject, emailContent, onSend) {
  const modal = document.createElement('div');
  modal.className = 'email-preview-modal';
  modal.innerHTML = `
    <div class="modal-content">
      <div class="modal-header">
        <h3>Email Preview</h3>
        <button class="close-button">&times;</button>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <div class="email-header">
          <div><strong>To:</strong> ${recipientName} (${recipientEmail})</div>
          <div><strong>Subject:</strong> ${subject}</div>
        </div>
        <div class="email-content">${emailContent}</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-footer">
        <button class="btn btn-secondary">Edit</button>
        <button class="btn btn-primary">Send Email</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  `;
  
  document.body.appendChild(modal);
  
  // Animation and event listeners
  setTimeout(() => modal.classList.add('show'), 10);
  
  modal.querySelector('.close-button').addEventListener('click', () => closeModal(modal));
  modal.querySelector('.btn-secondary').addEventListener('click', () => {
    // Open editing interface
    showEmailEditor(recipientEmail, recipientName, subject, emailContent, onSend);
    closeModal(modal);
  });
  
  modal.querySelector('.btn-primary').addEventListener('click', () => {
    closeModal(modal);
    if (onSend) onSend();
  });
}
```

## Individual vs. Team View Implementation

A critical requirement of this system is the ability to view both individual counselor data and team aggregate data. Here's how this dual-view approach will be implemented:

### View Switching System
```javascript
// VIEW SWITCHING SYSTEM
const viewModes = {
  INDIVIDUAL: 'individual',
  TEAM: 'team'
};

let currentViewMode = viewModes.TEAM;
let selectedCounselorId = null;

function switchViewMode(mode, counselorId = null) {
  currentViewMode = mode;
  selectedCounselorId = counselorId;
  
  // Update UI elements to reflect the current view
  updateViewModeIndicators();
  
  // Reload data based on the current view
  reloadDataForCurrentView();
}

function updateViewModeIndicators() {
  // Update view mode selector
  document.getElementById('viewModeSelector').value = currentViewMode;
  
  // Update counselor selector visibility
  const counselorSelector = document.getElementById('counselorSelector');
  counselorSelector.style.display = currentViewMode === viewModes.INDIVIDUAL ? 'block' : 'none';
  
  if (currentViewMode === viewModes.INDIVIDUAL) {
    // Update counselor selection if in individual mode
    document.getElementById('selectedCounselor').value = selectedCounselorId || '';
    
    // Update page title to include counselor name
    if (selectedCounselorId) {
      const counselorName = getCounselorName(selectedCounselorId);
      document.getElementById('pageTitle').textContent = `${counselorName}'s Dashboard`;
    } else {
      document.getElementById('pageTitle').textContent = 'Individual Dashboard';
    }
  } else {
    // Update page title for team view
    document.getElementById('pageTitle').textContent = 'Team Dashboard';
  }
}

function reloadDataForCurrentView() {
  showLoading();
  
  // Prepare parameters based on current view
  const params = {
    viewMode: currentViewMode,
    counselorId: selectedCounselorId,
    // Add other necessary parameters
  };
  
  // Load appropriate data
  google.script.run
    .withSuccessHandler(function(result) {
      if (result.success) {
        // Update all visualizations
        updateDashboardData(result.data);
        hideLoading();
      } else {
        showError(result.error);
        hideLoading();
      }
    })
    .withFailureHandler(function(error) {
      showError("Failed to load data: " + error);
      hideLoading();
    })
    .getDashboardData(params);
}
```

### Data Visualization for Dual Views
```javascript
// DATA VISUALIZATION FOR DUAL VIEWS
function updateDashboardData(data) {
  // Update metrics cards
  updateMetricsCards(data.metrics);
  
  // Update charts with appropriate data
  updateCharts(data.chartData);
  
  // Update tables
  updateTables(data.tableData);
  
  // Update session information
  updateSessionInfo(data.sessions);
}

function updateMetricsCards(metrics) {
  // Update different metrics based on view mode
  if (currentViewMode === viewModes.TEAM) {
    // Team aggregate metrics
    document.getElementById('totalCalls').textContent = metrics.totalCalls;
    document.getElementById('answerRate').textContent = `${metrics.answerRate}%`;
    document.getElementById('avgTalkTime').textContent = formatTime(metrics.avgTalkTime);
    document.getElementById('teamAvailability').textContent = `${metrics.availability}%`;
    // More team metrics...
  } else {
    // Individual counselor metrics
    document.getElementById('counselorCalls').textContent = metrics.calls;
    document.getElementById('counselorAnswerRate').textContent = `${metrics.answerRate}%`;
    document.getElementById('counselorTalkTime').textContent = formatTime(metrics.talkTime);
    document.getElementById('counselorAvailability').textContent = `${metrics.availability}%`;
    // More individual metrics...
  }
  
  // Update comparison to targets
  updateTargetComparisons(metrics);
}

function updateCharts(chartData) {
  // Clear existing charts
  clearCharts();
  
  // Create appropriate charts based on view mode
  if (currentViewMode === viewModes.TEAM) {
    // Team charts
    createTeamVolumeChart(chartData.volumeData);
    createQualityDistributionChart(chartData.qualityData);
    createTeamAvailabilityChart(chartData.availabilityData);
  } else {
    // Individual charts
    createIndividualPerformanceChart(chartData.performanceData);
    createQualityTrendChart(chartData.qualityTrendData);
    createSkillRadarChart(chartData.skillData);
  }
}
```

## SpreadsheetApp.getUi() Avoidance Strategy

### Key Strategies for Avoiding SpreadsheetApp.getUi()

1. **Client-Side Validation**: Implement comprehensive form validation in JavaScript rather than relying on server-side alerts.

2. **Custom Notification System**: Build your own toast notifications and modal dialogs within your HTML interfaces instead of using native Google dialogs.

3. **Batch Processing**: Reduce server round-trips by collecting and processing multiple items in a single server call.

4. **Progressive UI Feedback**: Provide immediate visual feedback without requiring server communication.

5. **Dynamic Form Generation**: Generate forms on the client side based on configuration data.

6. **Client-Side Data Caching**: Store frequently accessed data (like team members) in client-side cache to avoid unnecessary server calls.

7. **Optimized Sheet Interactions**: Structure your server-side code to minimize processing time.

### Implementation Examples

#### Custom Notification System (Instead of getUi().alert())
```javascript
// CLIENT-SIDE NOTIFICATION
function showCustomAlert(message, type = 'info') {
  const toast = document.createElement('div');
  toast.className = `toast toast-${type}`;
  toast.innerHTML = `
    <div class="toast-icon">
      <i class="fas fa-${type === 'success' ? 'check-circle' : 
                        type === 'error' ? 'exclamation-circle' : 
                        'info-circle'}"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="toast-message">${message}</div>
  `;
  
  document.getElementById('toast-container').appendChild(toast);
  
  // Animate in
  setTimeout(() => toast.classList.add('show'), 10);
  
  // Auto dismiss
  setTimeout(() => {
    toast.classList.remove('show');
    setTimeout(() => toast.remove(), 300);
  }, 3000);
}
```

#### Client-Side Form Validation (Instead of getUi().alert())
```javascript
// CLIENT-SIDE VALIDATION
function validateQualityReviewForm() {
  const counselorName = document.getElementById('counselorName').value.trim();
  const interactionDate = document.getElementById('interactionDate').value;
  const errors = [];
  
  // Validate required fields
  if (!counselorName) {
    errors.push("Counselor name is required");
    highlightField('counselorName');
  }
  
  if (!interactionDate) {
    errors.push("Interaction date is required");
    highlightField('interactionDate');
  }
  
  // Validate all criteria are rated
  const criteriaIds = ['opening1', 'opening2', 'risk1', 'risk2', 'comm1', 'comm2', 'comm3', 
                      'support1', 'support2', 'closure1', 'closure2'];
  
  criteriaIds.forEach(id => {
    if (!document.querySelector(`input[name="${id}"]:checked`)) {
      errors.push(`Please rate the criterion: ${getCriterionName(id)}`);
    }
  });
  
  // Display errors
  if (errors.length > 0) {
    showErrorToast(errors.join("<br>"));
    return false;
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

## Important Implementation Notes

1. **No Hard-Coded User Information**: This system is designed to be duplicated and used by any team lead. All user information should be stored in Google Sheets, not hard-coded in the application scripts.

2. **Configuration Through Settings**: Team leads should configure the system through a settings interface, connecting to their specific Google Sheets and setting preferences.

3. **Data Privacy Considerations**: Crisis services involve sensitive information. The system should implement appropriate privacy safeguards and data retention policies.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Crisis services operate 24/7, so the system must be optimized for reliability and performance even with large data sets.

5. **Accessibility**: The interface should be designed for accessibility, ensuring that team leads with diverse needs can effectively use the system.

6. **Mobile Compatibility**: Team leads may need to access the system from mobile devices during off-hours crisis situations.

## Conclusion

This enhanced crisis services team management system provides a comprehensive solution for supervising crisis counselors, particularly in LGBTQ+ support contexts. By avoiding SpreadsheetApp.getUi() and implementing client-side processing where possible, the system offers a responsive, efficient interface while maintaining the data integrity and accessibility benefits of Google Sheets.

The structured templates for one-on-ones, quality reviews, metrics tracking, coaching conversations, and time tracking ensure consistent documentation and analysis across all aspects of team leadership, ultimately supporting better crisis intervention services for vulnerable individuals.
